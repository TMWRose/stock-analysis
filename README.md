## Overview

In this module, we are helping Steve's parents pick where to invest their money in renewable energy stocks. They hadn't done much research and wanted to invest all of their money into DAQO New Energy Corp. Steve instead wanted to help his parents diverify their investment portfolio, so we used VBA to analyze a whole list of green energy stocks to give them options.
