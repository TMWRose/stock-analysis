# stock-analysis

## Overview

In this module, we are helping Steve's parents pick where to invest their money in renewable energy stocks. They hadn't done much research and wanted to invest all of their money into DAQO New Energy Corp. Steve instead wanted to help his parents diverify their investment portfolio, so we used VBA to analyze a whole list of green energy stocks to give them options. 

## Results

As you can see in the picture below, almost all of the top 12 companies analyzed had a great year in 2017, with DQ having the highest return. If you looked at just this year you might think that majority of these companies would be a safe investment.

However, in the following year, almost every company took a hit except for two. It's not readily apparent as to why the stocks all lost value, but a look into world events at the time might provide some insight. In the summer of 2017, President Trump removed the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, an international effort towards the fight against climate change. It wouldn't be hard to imagine that all renewable energy companies within the country lost a good bit of money from investors as not many would put money into an industry that seemingly had no future.
